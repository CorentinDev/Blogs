<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how Deferred Binding works in GWT and the use of the <code>Generator</code> class to create classes dynamically. <br />
The example we will use throughout this tutorial is the creation of an utility class which provides access to the properties of an object using the field names. This mechanism will prove very useful for solving recurrent problems like connecting a model to a GUI (also know as databinding).</p> <p>You can download the tutorial in PDF format (<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tutorial-binding-en.pdf">PDF article</a>) and the code (<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tutorial_gwt_binding.zip">GWT_Binding</a>).</p>
