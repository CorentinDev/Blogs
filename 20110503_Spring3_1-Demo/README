Demo project for Spring 3.1 features.

The first part of this demonstration is the ability to use profile for
different environments.
For this feature, the demonstration lay on different stages of the development:
- The testing step
 - For the service layer (assuming that other layers are working).
 - For the persistence layer (using an embedded persistence system).
- Integration and production stages (discovering the configuration through JNDI).

An "In Memory" storage is used during the service test, an embedded H2 database
is provided for tests on the persistence layer.

Of course this demonstration isn't the best use case available but due to the need
of a clean and light code it should be enough to understand the principles of
profiles and environment.
